# IoTLab-Base

You need to bring this device, assembled, coded and running to the '**Intro To Azure IoT Central with Windows IoT Core on the Raspberry Pi**' Hands on Lab as it is the starting point for the Lab.  In the two previous hands on labs '**Intro To Azure IoT Central with Windows IoT Core on the Raspberry Pi**' and '**Intro To Sensors with Windows IoT Core on the Raspberry Pi (Feel the Force Luke)**' we covered all the material required to assemble, code, debug and run this device so I won’t be going over any of that in the third lab as we have ton of new material to cover making this an Internet of Things device.

Note I don't care what color LED's, wire colors, layout, etc, you use, just that the device is assembled and running before you attend the lab.
